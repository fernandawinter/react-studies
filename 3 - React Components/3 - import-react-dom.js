// Import ReactDOM
// Another import we need in addition to React is ReactDOM:

// import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
// The methods imported from 'react-dom' interact with the DOM.

// The methods imported from 'react' do not deal with the DOM at all. They don’t engage directly with anything that isn’t part of React.

// To clarify: the DOM is used in React applications, but it isn’t part of React. After all, the DOM is also used in countless non-React applications. Methods imported from 'react' are only for pure React purposes, such as creating components or writing JSX elements.

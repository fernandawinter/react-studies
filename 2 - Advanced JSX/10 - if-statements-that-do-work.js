// JSX Conditionals: If Statements That Do Work
// How can you write a conditional if you canâ€™t inject an if statement into JSX?

// One option is to write an if statement and not inject it into JSX.

// Look at if.js. Follow the if statement, all the way from line 8 down to line 20.

// if.js works because the words if and else are not injected in between JSX tags. The if statement is on the outside, and no JavaScript injection is necessary.

// This is a common way to express conditionals in JSX.

// class vs className
// This lesson will cover more advanced JSX. You’ll learn some powerful tricks, and some common errors to avoid.

// Grammar in JSX is mostly the same as in HTML, but there are subtle differences to watch out for. Probably the most frequent of these involves the word class.

// In HTML, it’s common to use class as an attribute name:

// <h1 class="big">Hey</h1>
// In JSX, you can’t use the word class! You have to use className instead:

// <h1 className="big">Hey</h1>
// This is because JSX gets translated into JavaScript, and class is a reserved word in JavaScript.

// When JSX is rendered, JSX className attributes are automatically rendered as class attributes.

// On line 5, declare a new variable named myDiv. Set myDiv equal to a JSX <div></div> element.
// In between the <div></div> tags, write the text I AM A BIG DIV.
// Give your <div></div> the following attribute:
// className="big"

// Underneath your <div></div>, call ReactDOM.render.
// For ReactDOM.render()‘s first argument, pass in myDiv.
// For ReactDOM.render()‘s second argument, pass in document.getElementById('app').
// If your rendered <div></div> has a class of "big", then it should look big in the browser!

import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

// Write code here:
const myDiv = <div className="big">I AM A BIG DIV</div>;

ReactDOM.render(myDiv, document.getElementById("app"));

// Hello World
// Take a look at the following line of code:

// const h1 = <h1>Hello world</h1>;
// What kind of weird hybrid code is that? Is it JavaScript? HTML? Or something else?

// It seems like it must be JavaScript, since it starts with const and ends with ;. If you tried to run that in an HTML file, it wouldn’t work.

// However, the code also contains <h1>Hello world</h1>, which looks exactly like HTML. That part wouldn’t work if you tried to run it in a JavaScript file.

// What’s going on?

// Copy the following line into app.js:
// const h1 = <h1>Hello world</h1>;
// Click Run when you’re finished.


// The Mystery, Revealed
// Good!

// Take another look at the line of code that you wrote.

// Does this code belong in a JavaScript file, an HTML file, or somewhere else?

// The answer is…a JavaScript file! Despite what it looks like, your code doesn’t actually contain any HTML at all.

// The part that looks like HTML, <h1>Hello world</h1>, is something called JSX.

// JSX Elements
// A basic unit of JSX is called a JSX element.

//     Hereâ€™s an example of a JSX element:

// <h1>Hello world</h1>
// This JSX element looks exactly like HTML! The only noticeable difference is that you would find it in a JavaScript file, instead of in an HTML file.




// In app.js, write a JSX <p></p> element containing the text, Hello world. Use the example code above as a guide.

<p>Hello World</p>
